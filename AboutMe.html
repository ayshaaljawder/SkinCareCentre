                <p class = "AMP">
                    Skin has always been an issue with me.
                    I have endured different skin types and conditions from having dry skin and eczema to oily and
                    acneic skin.
                    Those tribulations allowed me to try different products and experiment with diverse skin treatments.
                    Throughout the years, I have gathered an extensive background on the use of skincare and its
                    significance in maintaining skin health.
                    Thus, I have decided to create a website that transforms my own struggles to something benefical for
                    fellow indiviuals suffering from skin issues
                    as I am aware of how an individual can be mentally affected by the state of their skin.

                <p class = "AMP">
                    However, it is important to remember to always be comfortable and not extract your worth or your
                    beauty from your skin.

                <p class = "AMP">
                    The information presented in this website is from my own personal experience and research.
                    I physically try and experiment with the products and provide with the review according to my
                    experience and the results that I have recieved.
                    The skincare ingredients and methods examined are based on personal research and usage of products
                    related to the specified topic.
                    The products are tried for a period of minimum 2 weeks in order to be able to formulate a
                    well-rounded opinion and review.
